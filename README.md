# Multi-BandBlending

Implements Pyramidal blending wherein a laplacian pyramid is created out of portions of images to be blended and then the pyramids themselves added per level to give a new third pyramid, which is then superimposed to give a new image

Coming Soon: 

Small linux executable to do pyramidal blending! Also some interesting 3D reconstruction work I'm doing! Like view based simulations? Stay tuned!!
